## Problem description

Reverse a singly linked list.

Example:

Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
Output: 5->4->3->2->1->NULL
Follow up:

A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

## Naive

Runtime: 0 ms Your runtime beats 100.00 % of cpp submissions.

Memory Usage: 13.6 MB Your memory usage beats 19.16 % of cpp submissions.

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        if(!head || !head->next) return head;
        
        vector<int> vals;
        
        ListNode* cur = head;
        
        while(cur){
            vals.push_back(cur->val);
            cur = cur->next;
        }
        
        int i = 0;
        cur = head;
        while(cur){
            cur->val = vals[vals.size()-1-i];
            cur = cur->next;
            i++;
        }
        
        return head;
    }
};
```

## Iterative

```cpp
//iterative
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* cur = head;
        ListNode* prev = head;
        while(cur!=NULL){
            ListNode* next = cur->next;
            if(cur==head){
                cur->next = NULL;
            }else{
                cur->next = prev;
            }
            prev = cur;
            cur = next;
        }
        return prev;
    }
};
```

## Recursive
The recursive version is slightly trickier and the key is to work backwards. Assume that the rest of the list had already been reversed, now how do I reverse the front part? 

Let's assume the list is: n1 → … → nk-1 → nk → nk+1 → … → nm → Ø

Assume from node nk+1 to nm had been reversed and you are at node nk.

n1 → … → nk-1 → nk → nk+1 ← … ← nm

We want nk+1’s next node to point to nk.

So,

nk.next.next = nk;

Be very careful that n1's next must point to Ø. 
If you forget about this, your linked list has a cycle in it. 
This bug could be caught if you test your code with a linked list of size 2.

Complexity analysis

Time complexity : O(n). 
Assume that nn is the list's length, the time complexity is O(n).

Space complexity : O(n).
The extra space comes from implicit stack space due to recursion. 
The recursion could go up to nn levels deep.

        if(head==NULL || head->next==NULL) return head;
        ListNode* p = reverseList(head->next);
        //head->next: tail of p
        //the new tail of p becomes head
        head->next->next = head;
        head->next = NULL;
        return p;
    }
};
```
